# Fentanyl Awareness Data Pipeline

An open-source data pipeline that automatically updates and publishes comprehensive fentanyl mortality data from CDC WONDER and the US Census.

## 🎯 What This Project Provides

- **📊 Ready-to-use CSV file**: Clean, validated fentanyl death data (1999-current)
- **📚 Live Documentation**: Interactive docs automatically updated every week
- **🔄 Automated Updates**: Fresh data published every Monday at 12:00 PM UTC
- **📈 Easy Access**: Download CSV, view docs, or analyze with your preferred tool

## 📂 For Different Users
